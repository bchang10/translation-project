      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
       
            Founded in 2024, Hmong Translation was borned to rekindle the passion for the culture and tradition. 
            With the numbers of speakers declining, we sought to allow others to understand the importance of the culture
            and to preserve the language. We hope to resonate our project to native and future speakers to join hands in
            growing the culture and community.
