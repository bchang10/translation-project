    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p> We're Brendan, Yee, and Nou, the team behind Hmong <br>
        Translation. Brendan, who works at Sentry, originally <br>
        started this project as a fun coding experiment. <br>
        Menka, serving in the Air Force, and Nou, a close friend who's <br>
        along for the ride. When we are not working, <br>
        you will find us playing video games, <br>
        enjoying disc golf, or caring for our beloved dogs. <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        We started this journey to inspire those interested in learning Hmong or simply looking to translate <br>
        and better understand the language. We hope you are excited to begin your Hmong journey with us!
